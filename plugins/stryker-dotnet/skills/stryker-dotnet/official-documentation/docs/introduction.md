Welcome to the documentation for Stryker for .NET. Also known as Stryker.NET or stryker-net.

# Stryker.NET

Stryker.NET offers you mutation testing for your .NET Core and .NET Framework projects. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs. Stryker.NET is installed using NuGet.

New to Stryker.NET? Begin with our guide on [getting started](./getting-started.md)

# Background

Stryker.NET joined the stryker family in 2018 based on the idea that the .NET landscape missed a good mutation testing tool that other languages have had for years. We believe mutation testing should be a bigger part of the .NET community.
